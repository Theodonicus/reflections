    When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
    local?

When collaborating with others a remote would be useful. Additionally, if you 
want to allow others access to experimental or developmental code between 
releases, using a remote repository would make that simple.


    Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
    automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might be working on something in your local repository that you are not 
ready to share, and you dont want an automatic pull to overwrite or modify and 
changes you're working on.
