    When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work 
    local?

When collaborating with others a remote would be useful. Additionally, if you 
want to allow others access to experimental or developmental code between 
releases, using a remote repository would make that simple.


    Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git 
    automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might be working on something in your local repository that you are not 
ready to share, and you dont want an automatic pull to overwrite or modify and 
changes you're working on.


    Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use 
    one instead of another?

Clones create a copy of a repository with the exact same committs present in the 
original cloned repository. A fork is essentially the same, except that it is 
done on Github and it links back to the original repository despite being 
considered its own seperate new repository. A branch pertains more to individual 
repositories. Branching allows you to implement features within an existing 
repository with out chaning your main code base. For example to implement 
experimental features that you may decide you do not want in the long run.


    What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote 
    stored locally?

You may want to work on a project from a place without internet access at some 
point, and by storing the most recent state of the remote you can compare your 
changes to that branch. This will allow you to know if you are ahead of the 
branch, behindm or out of sync.
