What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates the .git directory which stores information about the repository. 
Without initializing your repsository you are working with normal directories 
and files, that are not being tracked by git.


How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? 
What value do you think it offers?

The working directory includes all files in our current directory, while the 
staging area only includes files that are being utilized for the next commit. 
This could be useful if you do not want to add all the files in your working 
directory to the next commit. For example if some of the files are a part of a 
different logical change or feature, it might make sense to commit them 
seperately.


How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical 
change?

By only adding files to the staging area that are related to the logical change, 
you can make seperate commits for each change.


What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history 
organized? How would branches help?

If you want to create changes that have the potential the break the program or 
are experimental, you can create a branch for these changes, while leaving the 
master branch unchanged. In this way you may test test these new changes in your 
branch, but also still have access to the master version. This could allow you 
to fix bugs in the stable version for example, while testing new features in the 
experimental branch.


How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?

The diagrams make it clear which commits are reachable from the current 
position. Aditionally they make it more clear at which point branches seperated 
and how much they have diverged in that time.
